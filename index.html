  Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning and robotics have enabled agents to achieve superhuman performance on
  a variety of challenging games [1-4] and learn robotic skills [5-7]. While these results are very promising, several
  open problems remain. In order to function in real-world environments, learned policies must be both robust to input
  perturbations and be able to rapidly generalize or adapt to novel situations. Moreover, to collaborate and live with
  humans in these environments, the goals and actions of embodied agents must be interpretable and compatible with
  human representations of knowledge. Hence, it is natural to consider how humans so successfully perceive, learn, and
  plan to build agents that are equally successful.
</p>
<p>
  There is much evidence to suggest that objects are a core level of abstraction at which humans perceive and
  understand the world [8,9]. Objects have the potential to provide a compact, causal, robust, and generalizable
  representation of the world. They may be used effectively in a variety of important learning and control tasks,
  including learning environment models, decomposing tasks into subgoals, and learning task- or situation-dependent
  object affordances. Recently, there have been many advancements in scene representation, allowing scenes to be
  represented by their constituent objects, rather than at the level of pixels [10-14]. While these works have shown
  promising results, there is still a lack of agreement on how to best represent objects, how to learn object
  representations, and how best to leverage them in agent training.
</p>
<p>
	In this workshop we seek to build a consensus on what object representations should be by engaging with researchers
  from developmental psychology. Furthermore, we aim to define concrete tasks and capabilities that agents building on
  top of such abstract representations of the world should succeed at. We will discuss how object representations may
  be learned through invited presenters with expertise in unsupervised and supervised object representation learning
  methods. Finally, we will start conversations on new frontiers in object learning, both through a panel and speaker
  series as well as a broader call to the community for research on applications of object representations.

<h2>Workshop Goals and Outcomes</h2>
<p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <i>To host some of the world’s top child developmentalists, roboticists, and machine learning researchers in our set of
      talks and panels.</i> Objects are a primary concept in leading theories in developmental psychology on how young
    children explore and learn about the physical world. It has also been shown that objects are useful abstractions
    in designing machine learning algorithms for embodied agents. We hope such an opportunity will enable AI
    researchers to learn from cognitive scientists about core properties of objects that can be translated into
    inductive biases for algorithms, and cognitive scientists to learn from AI researchers the challenges in representing
    objects from real data.
  </li>
  <li><i>To define what an object representation is in terms of what it should do.</i> Specifically, we seek to create a
    consensus on the types of environments and tasks that will best explore the advantages and disadvantages of
    differing approaches to building object representations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>To develop an understanding of key challenges for applying object representations to real-world systems.</i>
    We facilitate this discussion by inviting experts on robotic control to talk about constraints, requirements, and
    use-cases for real-world perception. More generally, by viewing object perception and representation as a part of a
    larger system, we will facilitate a discussion about synergistic ways in which perception and control can interact.
    To that extent we will host a panel that includes experts from these respective domains.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i> To provide a hub for the object learning community and a venue for object representation and
    learning research focusing on a broader set of questions, including:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>How can object representations be learned?</i> How to learn object representations is still an open
        question. Many recent papers have explored this, often in simplified environments, but it is still unclear how
        an object representation of a realistic 3D environment may be quickly learned.</li>
      <li><i>Applications of object representations to language, explainability, and other areas.</i> The close
        alignment between object representations and human perception and understanding lends them to research areas
        that involve human interaction or data. In particular, we are excited to see research on intersections of
        grounded NLP and objects [15] and agent/robot interface and explainability using objects [16].</li>
