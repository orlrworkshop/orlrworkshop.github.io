title: "Understanding designed objects by program synthesis"
abstract: "In this position paper, we argue that short programs in high-level, Turing-complete, human-readable symbolic languages are an attractive representation for designed objects: they have potential benefits both for general agents and for simple AI/ML tools. In principle they allow all available structure to be captured, and they allow for introspection. They may also parallel mechanisms of human thought. Actually finding these programs is a very difficult but worthwhile research problem."
