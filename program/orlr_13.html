title: "Odd-One-Out Representation Learning"
abstract: "A common goal in representation learning is to meaningfully disentangle high-dimensional and complex observations of the world into their underlying ground-truth factors of variation. Recent work in disentangled representation learning has shown that unsupervised approaches rely on fully supervised disentanglement metrics, which assume access to labels for ground-truth factors of variation. In many real-world cases this is expensive to collect, or difficult to model, such as for perception. Here we empirically show that a weakly-supervised downstream task based on odd-one-out observations is suitable for model selection by observing high correlation with existing disentanglement metrics, as well as on a difficult downstream abstract visual reasoning task. We also show that a bespoke metric-learning VAE model which performs highly on this task also out-performs other standard unsupervised and a weakly-supervised disentanglement model across several metrics."
