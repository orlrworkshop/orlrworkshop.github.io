title: "The Omniglot Jr. challenge; Can a model achieve child-level character generation and classification?"
abstract: "Lake et al. 2015 presented the Omniglot data set, made up of 1623 different handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, and designed to study how people generate and classify those characters. They also proposed a model for one-shot learning of new concepts based on inferring compositionally structured generative models, and using those models to transfer from familiar concepts to new ones. Their Bayesian Programming Language (BPL) model was able to both classify and generate characters from the Omniglot data set in ways that were similar to adult behavior. However, adults have many years of experience, and even explicit instruction, in producing and comprehending letters. Would a similar model apply to children without this extensive prior knowledge? In this paper we introduce a new data set called Omniglot Jr. that is composed of a subset of the Omniglot letters as generated by children ages 3-6, We propose the challenge of achieving BPL benchmarks by both being able to classify and generate novel characters that are generated by children instead of adults.We present the results of training BPL with children's data in both classification and generation, and we find that BPL achieves higher classification accuracy and generates more adult looking letters than the children themselves do. This suggests that despite the inherent messiness of children's letters, their behavior reflects the same primitives and generation process that adults use. We challenge alternative models to perform on this data set. We also present the challenge of reproducing the children's distinctive pattern of mistakes. Adult abilities such as character recognition depend on the learning we do as children, this challenge should help us understand how that learning is possible, and how it can be simulated in computational systems."
