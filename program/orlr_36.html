title: "Object representations for robot manipulation"
abstract: "Reasoning about objects is a fundamental task in robot manipulation. Different representations can have important repercussions on the capabilities and generality of a manipulation system. In this talk I will discuss different ways we represent and reason about objects, ranging from explicit 3D models to raw point clouds."
