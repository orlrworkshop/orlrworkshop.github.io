- abstract: We all seem to know intuitively what an object is, however the notion
    of an object appears to be very hard to define precisely. In order to move forward
    in building better object representations for learning and reasoning, it is important
    to first agree on what objects are. In this talk I will propose an operational
    definition of objects using insights from physics. I will then use this definition
    to suggest what a good object-centered representation should look like, and why
    it might be useful for more efficient and robust learning and reasoning.

  title: What is an object?
- abstract: 'Objects and their interactions are the foundational structure of the
    world that plays the central role in our perception, reasoning, and control of
    the world. Incorporating such structural knowledge is thus expected to resolve
    various limitations of current deep learning systems in reasoning, causality,
    modularity, and systematic generalization. However, current deep learning systems
    are limited in providing such structures: they either extensively rely on human
    annotations or uses unsupervised representations with a minimal uninterpretable
    structure. In this talk, I present recent advances in object-centric latent variable
    models. I first argue that this class of models provide a probabilistic modeling
    framework to learn interpretable, structured, and adaptable representations as
    well as the compositional imagination of multi-object scenes in an unsupervised
    manner. Also, I present the benefits of combining symbolic and distributed representations
    in these models, and an approach to learn three-dimensional scene representations
    in an object-centric manner. I conclude that human-like AI agents should understand
    the causal structured of the world and the object-centric representations can
    be the foundation of building such world models.'

- abstract: "Research over the last few decades has shed considerable light on how\
    \ infants represent and reason about objects in simple physical events, such as\
    \ occlusion, containment, and support events. My talk summarizes key findings\
    \ from this research. First, representations of objects in physical events are\
    \ initially very sparse and lacking in featural detail; nevertheless, they are\
    \ still sufficient, when interpreted by infants\u2019 core physical knowledge,\
    \ to allow infants to correctly predict the outcomes of many physical events.\
    \ Second, object representations become richer and more detailed as infants form\
    \ event categories and, for each category, identify features that are causally\
    \ relevant for predicting outcomes. Third, once a feature has been identified\
    \ as relevant to an event category, it is represented for any event in the category,\
    \ thereby ensuring powerful generalization. Fourth, features identified in one\
    \ event category are not generalized to other event categories, even when equally\
    \ relevant, resulting at times in striking discrepancies in infants\u2019 responses\
    \ to similar events from different categories. Fifth, one of the learning mechanisms\
    \ by which infants identify features is explanation-based learning; because this\
    \ mechanism uses analytical as well as empirical evidence, it is highly efficient\
    \ and allows infants to acquire new featural rules with few exemplars. Finally,\
    \ the cognitive architecture that underlies early representations of objects in\
    \ physical reasoning includes at least two systems, an object-file and a physical-reasoning\
    \ system, each with a different role; understanding how each system represents\
    \ objects, how these representations change with experience, and how the two systems\
    \ exchange information as events unfold helps explain the findings described above.\
    \ Together, these findings make clear that object representations in infancy are\
    \ far from monolithic: They are both system-specific (the same object may be represented\
    \ differently in different systems) and event-specific (the same object may be\
    \ represented differently in different events), and they become gradually richer\
    \ with experience."
