<!--<p>The Zoom meeting rooms will be open only during the poster session timeslots (see the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a>), during which authors will join the meeting rooms to allow you to ask them questions face-to-face. We encourage you to first watch the presentation associated with the paper, and then join the Zoom meeting room to ask questions and engage in further discussion.</p>-->
