      is the Marshall L. Berkman Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and an investigator at the NSF-MIT Center
      for Brains, Minds and Machines. Her laboratory focuses on the sources of uniquely human cognitive capacities,
      including capacities for formal mathematics, for constructing and using symbols, and for developing comprehensive
      taxonomies of objects. She probes the sources of these capacities primarily through behavioral research on human
      infants and preschool children, focusing on the origins and development of their understanding of objects, actions,
      people, places, number, and geometry. In collaboration with computational cognitive scientists, she aims to test
      computational models of infants’ cognitive capacities. In collaboration with economists, she has begun to take
      her research from the laboratory to the field, where randomized controlled experiments can serve to evaluate
      interventions, guided by research in cognitive science, that seek to enhance young children’s learning.

      <b><a href="https://sungjinahn.com">Sungjin Ahn</a></b> is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at
      Rutgers University and directs the Rutgers Machine Learning (RUML) lab. He is also affiliated with Rutgers Center
      for Cognitive Science. His research focus is on how an AI-agent can learn the structure and representations of
      the world in an unsupervised and compositional way, with a particular interest in object-centric learning. His
      approach to achieving this is based on deep learning, Bayesian modeling, reinforcement learning, and inspiration
      from cognitive & neuroscience. He received Ph.D. at the University of California, Irvine with Max Welling and did
      a postdoc with Yoshua Bengio at Mila. Then, he joined Rutgers University in Fall 2018. He has co-organized ICML
      2020 Workshop on Object-Oriented Learning and received the ICML best paper award in ICML 2012.

      <b><a href="http://labs.psychology.illinois.edu/infantlab/renee.html">Ren&eacute;e Baillargeon</a></b> is an Alumni
      Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research examines
      cognitive development in infancy and focuses primarily on causal reasoning. In particular, she explores how
      infants make sense of the events they observe, and what explanatory frameworks and learning mechanisms enable them
      to do so. In addition to this primary focus on causal reasoning, she is interested in a broad range of related
      issues including object perception, categorization, object individuation, number, and executive-function skills.

      <b><a href="https://wcarvalho.github.io/">Wilka Carvalho</a></b> is a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the
      University of Michigan–Ann Arbor where he is advised by Honglak Lee, Satinder Singh, and Richard Lewis. His
      long-term research goal is to develop cognitive theories of learning that help us understand how humans infer,
      reason with, and exploit the rich structure present in realistic visual scenes to enable sophisticated behavioral
      policies. Towards this end, he is studying how object-centric representation learning and reinforcement learning
      can bring us closer to human-level artificial intelligence. He is supported by an NSF GRFP Fellowship and a UM
      Rackham Merit Fellowship.

      where she studies how to build machines that can flexibly build and deploy models of the world. Her work combines
      insights from cognitive science with structured relational architectures, model-based deep reinforcement
      learning, and planning. Jessica received a Ph.D. in Psychology from UC Berkeley in 2017, and an M.Eng. and B.S.

      <b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YWVuCKUAAAAJ&hl=en">Irina Higgins</a></b> is a research
      scientist at DeepMind, where she works in the Frontiers team. Her work aims to bring together insights from the
      fields of neuroscience and physics to advance general artificial intelligence through improved representation
      learning. Before joining DeepMind, Irina was a British Psychological Society Undergraduate Award winner for her
      achievements as an undergraduate student in Experimental Psychology at Westminster University, followed by a
      DPhil at the Oxford Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence, where she focused on
      understanding the computational principles underlying speech processing in the auditory brain. During her DPhil,
      Irina also worked on developing poker AI, applying machine learning in the finance sector, and working on speech
      recognition at Google Research.
